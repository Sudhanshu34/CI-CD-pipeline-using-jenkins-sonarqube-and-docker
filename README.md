# CICD-Jenkins-SonarQube-Docker-AWS
Implementing simple ci/cd pipeline using jenkins, sonarqube, github, webhook, docker, nginx all in aws ec2 to host a static website.
Firstly fetching the code from github using webhook (on push or pull requests) then scanning the code using sonarqube (ec2 type: t2 small) and then build a new docker image and run a new container (nginx) from it and trying to access the new container which deployed on ec2 through the browser.

Setting up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Install Jenkins: Start by installing Jenkins on your server or machine. You can follow the official Jenkins documentation for detailed installation instructions.

Configure Jenkins: Once Jenkins is installed, access the Jenkins web interface and configure basic settings such as security, plugins, and system configurations. Ensure that you have the necessary plugins for Docker integration.

Set up Source Code Management: Connect Jenkins to your version control system (e.g., Git) and configure it to pull your source code repository.

Create a Jenkins Pipeline: Create a new Jenkins pipeline job that defines your CI/CD process. You can use a Jenkinsfile or configure the pipeline directly in Jenkins using the GUI. The pipeline should include stages for building, testing, analyzing code quality, and deploying the application.

Build and Test Stage: In the build stage, use Docker to build your application within a container. You can create a Dockerfile that defines the build environment and dependencies. After the build, run your tests to ensure the code quality and functionality.

SonarQube Analysis: Integrate SonarQube into the pipeline to perform code quality analysis. SonarQube helps identify code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. Set up a SonarQube server and configure Jenkins to run SonarQube analysis as part of the pipeline. You'll need to install and configure the SonarQube Scanner plugin in Jenkins and specify the necessary SonarQube project settings.

Artifact Creation: After the build and SonarQube analysis, create a deployable artifact, such as a Docker image, that contains your application and its dependencies.

Deployment Stage: Define a deployment stage in the Jenkins pipeline to deploy your application. Depending on your deployment target (e.g., a local Docker instance, a Kubernetes cluster), you can use the appropriate Jenkins plugins or command-line tools to deploy the artifact.

Post-Deployment Steps: After the deployment, you may have additional steps, such as running integration tests, monitoring the application, or notifying stakeholders about the deployment status. Configure these steps in the Jenkins pipeline accordingly.

Triggering the Pipeline: Set up a trigger mechanism for the pipeline. You can configure Jenkins to automatically start the pipeline whenever there is a code change in your repository (e.g., using webhooks or polling).

With the above steps, you should have a CI/CD pipeline in place that utilizes Jenkins for orchestrating the process, Docker for containerization, and SonarQube for code quality analysis. Customize the pipeline as per your specific requirements and make sure to handle error handling, rollback mechanisms, and other considerations to ensure a robust and reliable pipeline.
